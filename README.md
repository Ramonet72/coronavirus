# CoronaVirus Race
Hi

This is a test project. My first website. I'm learning HTML, JS, and CSS.  It is also the first time I used Github so I have no much idea how this works.

The website is a funny Coranavirus race. Using real data.

Fair use:  It is foreseen a fair use of resources in this website. Some of the images i used can be from sources with copyrights. Please if you think this it's offensive let me know and I will remove and replace those images.

Thanks.

Ray
