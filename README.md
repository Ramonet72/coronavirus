# CoronaVirus Race
Hi

This is a test project. My first website. I'm learning HTML, JS, and CSS these days. It is also the first time I used Github so I have no much idea how this works.

The website is a funny Coronavirus race. Using real data.  It's make for fun but also with respect to this disgraceful infection that is affecting the world. Perhaps we cna create better awareness and help people. 

The code is not very much clean or efficient, so I would not recommend you to use it or take as a good practice..hahaha.  But I hope I will be refinining it and cleaning it in the next months, if I continue with it.

Fair use:  It is foreseen a fair use of resources in this website. Some of the images i used can be from sources with copyrights. Please if you think this it's offensive let me know and I will remove and replace those images.

Thanks. Be Safe!

Ray
